👋 Hi, I’m Samira-Khudaida

👀 I’m a curious beginner with a strong interest in C# programming and the .NET Framework.

🌱 I’m currently learning C# and enjoy exploring every line of code with a critical eye.

🖊 I love sketching out ideas on paper first — then bringing them to life as real, working programs.

🎨 I have a special appreciation for CSS, but I’m also increasingly fascinated by data architecture and system design.

💬 I’m always open to learning new things and sharing what I discover along the way.

📫 Feel free to reach out via GitHub!

🔭 Looking ahead, I aim to keep improving — by developing software that solves real problems more efficiently, cleverly, and with meaningful impact.
